## Home Page Redesign

This project is a redesigned home page focused on improving user experience by making the menu more accessible, personalizing card arrangements based on user usage, and offering a toggle feature for the side menu to increase central screen space.

## Features

1. **Quick Access Section**  
   A new section has been added for quick access, allowing users to easily navigate the available menu items. This section helps users understand what options they have, even if the entire menu isnâ€™t visible.

2. **Dynamic Card Rearrangement**  
   Cards on the homepage are now dynamically rearranged based on user interaction, allowing frequently used items or favorites to appear first for a more personalized experience.

3. **Toggleable Side Menu**  
   The side menu can now be toggled open or closed. This gives users more control over their layout, freeing up more space in the center of the page when the side menu is not needed.

## Tech Stack

- **React.js**: For building the user interface.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For fast and efficient styling, ensuring a responsive and modern design.
